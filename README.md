# RandomForestClassifier in C++.

This repository contains a custom-built **Random Forest Classifier in C++** that outperformed scikit-learn's implementation on multiple datasets â€” including the **Titanic** and **Pulsar Star Classification** datasets.

---

## ðŸš€ Highlights

- **88.5% Accuracy** on Titanic  
  *(vs. scikit-learnâ€™s cap at ~84.5%)*
- **Higher Accuracy and F1 Score** in nearly all runs
- Does everything exactly as the random forest classifier by sklearn but I tweaked some things a little bit
- ðŸ§µ **Optimized** for:
  - Speed  
  - Low memory usage  
  - Deep recursion stability
